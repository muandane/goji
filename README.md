> [!NOTE]
> Commitizen-like tool for formatting commit messages using emojis written in go.

**goji** is an easy-to-use commit message formatting tool, inspired by Commitizen and cz-cli,
that helps you create conventional commits with emojis with streamlined [git] commit process by providing a user-friendly TUI
for selecting the type of change, scope, and description of your commit message..

```sh
? Select the type of change you are committing: (Use arrow keys)
‚ùØ feature   ‚ú®  Introducing new features.
  fix       üêõ  Fixing a bug.
  docs      üìö  Documentation change.
  refactor  üé®  Improve structure/format of the code.
  clean     üî•  Remove code or files.
? What is the scope of this change? (class or file name): (press [enter] to skip)
>
```

## Features

- Interactive and Non-interactive CLI with sensible defaults for choosing commit types, scopes, and descriptions and signing off commits.
- Predefined commit types with corresponding emojis.
- Customizable commit types and scopes through a JSON configuration file.
- Supports Git out of the box

## Install

**Homebrew (macOs/Linux)**

```sh
brew install muandane/tap/goji
```

**Linux (or WSL)**

```sh
VERSION=$(curl --silent "https://api.github.com/repos/muandane/goji/releases/latest" | jq .tag_name -r)
curl -Lso goji.tar.gz https://github.com/muandane/goji/releases/download/$VERSION/goji_${VERSION}_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
tar -xvzf goji.tar.gz
chmod +x ./goji
# optionnal
sudo mv ./goji /usr/local/bin/
```

**Windows (winget)**

```sh
winget install muandane.goji
```

**Build locally**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/muandane/goji.git && cd goji
go build -ldflags "-s -w -X goji/cmd.version=0.0.8"
mv goji /usr/local/bin
goji --version
```

## Usage

Simply run `goji` in your terminal to start the interactive commit process:

![Goji gif](public/goji-demo.gif)

If you don't want the interactive screen you can use the flags to construct a message:

```sh
goji --type feat --scope home --message "Add home page"
```

## Check command

To check if a commit message is conventional run:

```sh
goji check
```

To use the check command, add the following to your pre-commit hook in your git repository:

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/muandane/goji
  rev: v0.0.8
  hooks:
  - id: goji-check
    name: goji check
    description: >
      Check whether the current commit message follows commiting rules. Allow empty commit messages by default, because they typically indicate to Git that the commit should be aborted.
```

## Customization

By default `goji` comes ready to run out of the box and you can initialize a config file with commands. _For now customization is in the works (?)_

```sh
goji init --repo # Writes the config in the git repo's root
goji init --global # Writes the config to home directory
```

**HOW TO**

You can customize the `.goji.json` generated file to add or change the scopes, types and other parameters:

```json
{
  "types": [
    //***
    {
      "emoji": "‚ú®",
      "code": ":sparkles:",
      "description": "Introducing new features.",
      "name": "feat"
    },
    {
      "emoji": "üêõ",
      "code": ":bug:",
      "description": "Fixing a bug.",
      "name": "fix"
    }
    //***
  ],
  "scopes": [
    "home",
    "accounts",
    "ci"
  ],
  "noemoji": false,
  "skipquestions": [],
  "subjectmaxlength": 50,
  "signoff": true
}
```

Only `"Scopes"` question can be skipped since it's optional according to the [Commit Spec](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

### Configuration options

| Option | Type | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ----------- |
| `types` | Array of objects | Types for the commit messages (emoji, code, description, name) |
| `scopes` | Array of strings | Optional scopes for the commit messages (you can auto-complete with ctrl+e) |
| `noemoji` | Boolean | Creates commit message with emojis in types |
| `subjectmaxlength` | Number | Maximum length for the description message |
| `signoff` | Boolean | Add a sign off to the end of the commit message |
| `skipquestions` | Array of strings | Skip prompting for these questions (Unimplemented)|
